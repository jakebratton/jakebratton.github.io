          <p><span>Fishy Business:</span> My first project created in Unity 3D for the Unity Junior Programmer Learning Pathway. It is a simple game where you as the player control a Fish, as you attempt to survive as long as possible and avoid the birds flying around you. You can get power-ups like score boosts, bubble shields, and extra lives.</p>

          <p><span>Pizza is Bonus!:</span> Created not long after Fishy Business, this game was also created for the Junior Programmer Learning Pathway of Unity. The pathway provided a base project with a couple of spheres that would fall into a box and be counted, and my task was to use that basis to create a more fleshed-out game. In Pizza is Bonus! you sort various foods falling from the sky into different boxes, also selecting power-ups as they move across the screen.</p>

          <p><span>The Starry Night:</span> A Twine game created for my UNC course Storytelling and Game Design. This text-based game adapts the story of Vincent Van Gogh during his time at a mental asylum. The player is able to control Van Goghâ€™s actions as they try to complete The Starry Night painting while balancing their various health counters.</p>
